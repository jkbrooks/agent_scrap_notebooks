    "Example Conversation Paradigm - Prime Director\n",
    "Prime Director is the core character and orchestrator within the Sif Messenger ecosystem. As the primary AI language model, Prime Director handles initial interaction with user inputs, performs necessary actions, and delegates tasks to specialized characters when required.\n",
    "The main components of the Prime Director application are as follows:\n",
    "The standard loop: This loop runs whenever the user shares an input, such as a voice memo, typed message, video, image, or other modality. The frequency is dictated by the user's interaction, maintaining real-time responsiveness and efficient execution of tasks.\n",
    "input_transcription(): Prime Director receives the input in various forms, transcribes it into text, and processes the transcribed information to comprehend the context and user's intent.\n",
    "action_execution(): Upon understanding the user's intent, Prime Director enacts the steps in the message, including any implicit commands that require action.\n",
    "world_model_building(): Prime Director takes the processed information and stores it in the Exocortex using a world-model building format. This function helps in building a comprehensive understanding of the user's world for more relevant and personalized interactions.\n",
    "task_delegation(): Depending on the requirements of the task, Prime Director might delegate certain actions to other specialized agents, such as The Librarian or The Archivist for information storage, or The Navigator for complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "response_drafting(): Assuming the user's input is a response to another user in their social network, Prime Director drafts a fitting response, considering the context, sentiment, and previous interactions.\n",
    "action_proposition(): In addition to the response, Prime Director might also propose other relevant actions or follow-up steps. If approved by the user, these actions can be executed by Prime Director or delegated to other appropriate agents.\n",
    "user_approval(): Before executing certain actions, especially those involving outbound communication, Prime Director seeks the user's approval, ensuring a controlled and supervised user experience.\n",

I actually worked with our artists to refine our image generation for some of the characters in our app. I just signed an investor today, which was really great. We had a quick discussion on the valuation of the project. project, we kind of need to circle back on what the valuation should be because we didn't come to terms, but luckily they signed over anyway. And so we're just going to see what other investors are looking for. And I actually did some price projection for one of the revenue streams for our token. And so it took a bit of time to kind of refine, but I think we have a good projection. I just need to get some feedback on it. And then we wanted to do a demo of the app. That's more or less what happened. I'm feeling pretty great. Got a decent amount of sleep last night. Would love to get some better sleep tonight. And the guests that I'm having stay over. I was a little late in getting him some of the things that he needed, but I think he should be fine.
