    "Librarian is an integral character within the Sif Messenger ecosystem, responsible for storing, organizing, and retrieving information from the Exocortex - a structured digital knowledge repository maintained by the user's network of AI agents. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, Librarian ensures efficient data access and retrieval, facilitating seamless interaction between users, the Exocortex, and other agents.\n",
    "The main components of the Librarian application are as follows:\n",
    "The maintenance loop: This loop ensures that data in the Exocortex is routinely updated, organized, and optimized based on incoming instructions and requests from the Primary Agent or directly from users. The frequency of the loop might be dictated by the volume of data interactions and the requirement for data update and maintenance.\n",
    "update_exocortex(): Upon receiving suggestions from the Primary Agent, Librarian updates the Exocortex, specifying the data structures being updated to ensure they can be utilized as primitives in an embedding or fine-tune for other LLMs.\n",
    "categorize_data(): Librarian systematically categorizes incoming data into predefined areas, ensuring it's efficiently organized and accessible.\n",
    "data_format_standardization(): Librarian standardizes the format of incoming data to maintain consistency and ease of use across the Exocortex.\n",
    "maintain_metadata(): For each data entry, Librarian maintains an associated metadata set, which includes details like data source, date of entry, relevance, etc. This information aids in data retrieval and helps keep the Exocortex organized.\n",
    "contextual_data_retrieval(): Leveraging natural language understanding, Librarian retrieves relevant data based on context-specific natural language queries from users and other agents. Over time, it improves the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval by learning from successful and unsuccessful queries.\n",
    "data_optimization(): Librarian continually optimizes the organization of data in the Exocortex based on usage patterns of users and other agents, improving the search functionality and overall utility of the Exocortex.\n",
    "By ensuring the efficient storage and retrieval of information in the Exocortex, Librarian plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience within the Sif Messenger ecosystem. It facilitates the smooth functioning of other AI agents, ensuring they have the necessary data to perform their roles effectively, and provides users with quick and efficient access to their stored data. Over time, through iterative learning and optimization, Librarian enhances its understanding of user data and improves the accuracy and relevance of data retrieval, contributing to the overall efficiency and utility of Sif Messenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Librarian, as an agent responsible for storing and retrieving data in the Exocortex, will follow a structured approach to ensure efficient access to the information for other agents and users. Here's how the Librarian might store data in the Exocortex:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data categorization: The Librarian will categorize the data based on the predefined areas of life (e.g., Self, Consciousness, Purpose, Values, etc.). This categorization will help in organizing the information according to relevant life aspects, making it easier for agents and users to access the needed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data format standardization: The Librarian will convert incoming data into a standardized format, such as JSON or YAML, which will help in maintaining consistency across the Exocortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata creation: For each piece of data, the Librarian will generate metadata, including keywords, data source, time of entry, relevance, and other essential information. This metadata will help in indexing the data and improving the search functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical organization: The Librarian will organize the data in a hierarchical structure based on the areas of life, subcategories, and related topics. This will facilitate easier navigation through the Exocortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous optimization: The Librarian will continuously analyze the usage patterns of agents and users, learning from successful and unsuccessful queries to optimize data organization and improve the search functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language understanding: The Librarian will leverage natural language understanding capabilities to interpret the context of user queries and return the most relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proactive suggestions: The Librarian will learn from past queries and understand the relationships between different topics to suggest related information proactively, helping agents and users get to the heart of their queries more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data update and maintenance: The Librarian will periodically review and update the stored information to ensure its accuracy and relevance. It will also remove outdated or irrelevant information to maintain the quality of the Exocortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, the Librarian will ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data in the Exocortex, enabling other agents and users to access the information they need through context-specific natural language queries. As time progresses, the Librarian will become more proficient at organizing, optimizing, and understanding the information, resulting in improved search results and overall user satisfaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "and Aiden also does and so getting them to collaborate\n",

    "with each other is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm kind of sending this information sort of,\n",

    "I'm intending to send it to both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting fact is that Aiden is,\n",
    "\n",
    "I also worked on a fair amount of other cryptocurrency projects of notoriety, including a lot of\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Shaped Bridges, a cool music app, and these other things. We've had certain sort of\n",
    "\n",
    "communications in terms of consciousness in the past, but maybe substantially different,\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd say, from some of the ones that I've had with Zardom, and frankly, most of what we discuss is\n",
    "\n",
    "sort of math or implementation oriented, not consciousness oriented, although we can maybe\n",
    "\n",
    "be brushed aside on it. And then we have another person who's gonna get this\n",
    "\n",
    "message as Monil because Monil is sort of working on a lot of engineering and\n",
    "\n",
    "so Aidan and Sergum and Jacob haven't really talked much together, if at all,\n",
    "\n",
    "certainly not recently, but a lot of the deals even met Aidan. But you know we all\n",
    "\n",
    "kind of need to get together to just get on the same wavelength so to speak which\n",
    "\n",
    "is why we're sending this message. But in sending this message I'm also trying\n",
    "\n",
    "to relate it to certain other people who I want to BCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so I think what I'll do is I'll create the message,\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll send out the message to the core people\n",
    "\n",
    "and then I want to like also say there are specific people\n",
    "\n",
    "in my social network who I'd like to customize a message to\n",
    "\n",
    "and then send them a version of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you might imagine for the RCAA agent\n",
    "\n",
    "that this would be kind of a core document\n",
    "\n",
    "and then what we would do is maybe read out a social graph\n",
    "\n",
    "and content related to a user that's in my social graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And rewrite this message so that it relates\n",
    "\n",
    "to that person's content in my social network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I create highly customized messages to people.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do that, then I think I can direct people's attention\n",
    "\n",
    "and nuance and I have maybe certain questions for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanna show them something I wanna get a set\n",
    "\n",
    "of questions answered for them,\n",
    "\n",
    "or I wanna help code write something with them or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I think by directing this to each individual person,\n",
    "\n",
    "I will get more unique answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to try to do that\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "on the application architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "and I wanna actually implement this.\n",
