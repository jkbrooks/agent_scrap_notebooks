The VentureFlow Architect is aimed to understand Alex's startup, analyze the information provided, and update the internal VC team profile with new data.\n",

Our AI models are designed to streamline project coordination and workflow optimization, improving productivity and reducing costs. I have a comprehensive pitch deck that details our mission, business model, team, and financials. Would you like me to share it?\n",

    "# After analyzing the pitch deck, the VentureFlow Architect updates the internal profile with the key details: venture's mission, business model, market size, competitive landscape, financials, team strength, and growth potential.\n",
    "# VentureFlow Architect: Your pitch deck is quite informative, Alex. I see you have a strong team with a background in the AI and healthcare industry. Your projected financials also indicate a promising business model. Considering our investment thesis and your work on AIGC technologies in the healthcare sector, your venture seems aligned with our focus. I do have a few questions about your risk assessment. Could you tell me more about the market, legal, financial, and operational risks you foresee?\n",

For the market risk, as you may know, the healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and the acceptance rate for new technologies can be slower than in other sectors. On the legal side, data privacy is a significant concern. We are heavily investing in making sure we are compliant with all healthcare data regulations.\n",

However, we are confident in our ability to innovate and stay ahead of the curve.\n",

Our healthcare team members have experience working in hospitals, and they bring in-depth knowledge about healthcare workflows. This unique blend of expertise enables us to tailor our AI models to specifically meet the needs of healthcare institutions.\n",

     "evalue": "Could not parse LLM output: Yeah, as you mentioned, this is really an informational deck. It's not a presentation deck. The liquidity is sourced from what we call matchers. Matchers are like lenders, so any arbitrary DeFi user who wants capital can actually lend on our platform. We call it matching because they actually countertrade on our platform and then they hedge their countertrade on a different platform. We actually have an auto hedging feature which we've, or maybe 90% of the way done with or 95% of the way done with, that will automatically hedge a user's trade on DYDX and presumably we can allow them to do hedging on other platforms as well.\n\nThe liquidation design is pretty straightforward. We are doing a contract for differences structure, so there isn't really a risk of things like cascading liquidations. Users are just trading against a price fee. They're not actually borrowing or trading against the actual underlying asset. So for example, if you use USDC to long Bitcoin, the lender or matcher in our case does not have Bitcoin. What's happening is there's just a contract for difference in structure in which users can lend capital and then the trader is actually given either returns or lack thereof depending on the price of Bitcoin, but it's all based on price signal. As a result, there isn't really a need for things like cascading liquidations or any other stuff, which means users who are trading get more or less the exact price that they would otherwise.\n\nThere is a slight buffer, a minor fee that we charge upon open and closing a position, which helps give some extra leeway for lenders and matchers in case they decide to, when they hedge on other platforms, they actually will still have to deal with liquidations and slippage and so forth. But on our system, the traders don't actually pay any liquidation fee or anything like that. There's no sort of threshold between a liquidation on our platform and something like a total liquidation. We don't necessarily strictly speaking need an insurance fund or things like that.\n\nHow do we do risk control? Again, it would be good to understand better, but something to keep in mind is that, again, we don't really have a... We're doing contract for differences, which means the underlying is never actually provided to the trader and it's not sourced by the match or slash lender. So we were able to do up to 100x leverage or even more than that. And the only risk is really... The risk is almost entirely borne on the trader. The trader may get liquidated as they would have in their platform, but they don't have a risk of causing others to be liquidated with any kind of cascading liquidation. And the lender is always going to get their capital back on our platform because if a trader gets liquidated, although again, because if they've hedged on another platform, they need to deal with external risk from that platform.\n\nAs far as the most important differentiators, I would say one of the biggest ones is that we have leveraged lending or what we call concentrated lending. This basically means that we can lend a lot more capital with or provide capital for a lot more trades without with relatively little underlying capital. So for example, if we want to lend out $1 million, we can actually do that with something like ten to maybe thirty thousand dollars worth of capital from matchers. And those matchers may want to hedge again on other platforms but even still if they do, they don't need that much liquidity. They can hedge as they may elsewhere. No other platform that we've seen actually does something like this and if you look at the amount of capital that's lent on most platforms, it's, you know, they have a standard volume that is between maybe 100,000 and two or $3 million. We can easily climb the ranks. And so, you know, if we get as much capital as like, you know, 550K or something like that from lenders, from matchers on our platform, then we are expected to quickly make a splash by being able to actually have open interest and daily trading volume in the several millions. And so we expect that what's gonna happen is we will quickly rise in usage and people will just be talking about our volumes pretty seriously.\n\nSo again, as a trader, you can expect to get additional liquidity here. The con obviously for this concentrated liquidity is that, concentrated lending is that you can only borrow, you can only get a certain amount of profit. So it's usually either 100% or 180% or 200%. You couldn't get, for example, 1,000% in the case of a runaway trade, but we think that this is a worthwhile trade-off. And we can certainly actually allow for higher percentages in terms of wins or profit for traders in the future.\n\nAnother big, important difference is that while we have concentrated lending, we don't require our users to, we still have the same amount of interest that would go to a lender otherwise. So for example, if a user is lending, say $10,000 at a 10x leverage, they're still giving yield as though they actually provided the entire $100,000 worth of capital. This is how we're able to charge dozens or even 100% plus APR, whereas other lending platforms can't offer as much because they're not concentrating the lend capital from the matchers.\n\nSo I'd say those are the two biggest ones. There are a couple other differentiators, for example, we're able to allow for trading against any asset, even non-crypto assets, so we can do stocks and other sorts of things because we're just using price oracles, we're not using the actual underlying. I don't think this is as big of a difference, but it is certainly relatively large. I think our referral program can actually be a really great differentiator. I would say the first two things that I mentioned are the biggest differentiators, but those are a couple of other ones. And I think that's kind of related to the competitive advantage that we have. I think that we have the capacity to build a lot of trading volume really quickly, even with relatively low capital that's lent because the amount of capital that's borrowed is concentrated and so we can do 20-30x. And so I think we're going to be able to basically quickly be the go-to place for liquidity. I just haven't seen the other with concentrated liquidity. Another one might be the use of deployment on any platform. So we can certainly deploy on BNB chain but we're actually able to really easily deploy on other chains as well given our modular architecture.\n\nThe main utility of the token is the interest that you get. So as a token holder, you get governance rights and you also get interest from all of the trading that occurs on the platform. There is actually in addition some additional utility that we want to provide, governance for layer one chain and a few other things but we haven't discussed it as much because we're primarily focused on governance and interest revenue. Even still, I think we would be one of the best tokens for gaming interest, one of the best revenue-generating tokens. There is other stuff related to AI and a few other cool things that we would want to discuss but now may not be the best time. I suppose it really just depends on investor appetite. We're happy to discuss our AI work which is almost an entirely separate product line but frankly we know that investors tend to focus on either just crypto or just AI so we don't talk about it that much.\n\nAs far as project status, we've actually soft-launched the protocol. We've had a set number of traders actively using it. We can link to the tool right now. Anyone can trade on it at the present moment. Although we haven't done much marketing on it, we're just taking in user feedback and iteratively improving it. So yeah, we want to build up additional capital reserves, get additional lenders on the platform, which we've done almost no reach outs for, but we certainly will in the future. And once we feel like we've built up a pretty good base of matchers, we will then do additional outreach. We also want to get tokens from Axler on for SIF chain. And then I think one of the biggest things that we can do is deploy to BNB chain. SIF chain is just in a position to be able to provide a bridge to other chains. And so we've kind of pivoted a lot of our roadmap. But if we do deploy to BNB chain, then we can use Binance's bridge to Ethereum to make auto hedging much easier, much more streamlined, and we can build to a wider audience so people can import and export tokens from Ethereum really easily. And once we've done that, we really want to go out loud. We think we can get millions or even tens of millions of liquidity in terms of open trading. I think it would really make a big splash. And then maybe in the next few months, we'd like to also have our own layer one chain. We certainly have SIFT chain, which is already quite nice, but having another layer one chain might be useful. We also want to deploy to other chains, probably Arbitrum, Ethereum, other EVMs, other Cosmos chains even, those things could all actually be quite appealing. So those are other things that we have. And then again, as I mentioned, we have AI trading assistance that we can help on terms of chatbots that may help people talk through trades. We aren't super ready to discuss that as much now, but it is something that we expect to do over the next three to six months.",

      "\u001b[0;31mOutputParserException\u001b[0m: Could not parse LLM output: Yeah, as you mentioned, this is really an informational deck. It's not a presentation deck. The liquidity is sourced from what we call matchers. Matchers are like lenders, so any arbitrary DeFi user who wants capital can actually lend on our platform. We call it matching because they actually countertrade on our platform and then they hedge their countertrade on a different platform. We actually have an auto hedging feature which we've, or maybe 90% of the way done with or 95% of the way done with, that will automatically hedge a user's trade on DYDX and presumably we can allow them to do hedging on other platforms as well.\n\nThe liquidation design is pretty straightforward. We are doing a contract for differences structure, so there isn't really a risk of things like cascading liquidations. Users are just trading against a price fee. They're not actually borrowing or trading against the actual underlying asset. So for example, if you use USDC to long Bitcoin, the lender or matcher in our case does not have Bitcoin. What's happening is there's just a contract for difference in structure in which users can lend capital and then the trader is actually given either returns or lack thereof depending on the price of Bitcoin, but it's all based on price signal. As a result, there isn't really a need for things like cascading liquidations or any other stuff, which means users who are trading get more or less the exact price that they would otherwise.\n\nThere is a slight buffer, a minor fee that we charge upon open and closing a position, which helps give some extra leeway for lenders and matchers in case they decide to, when they hedge on other platforms, they actually will still have to deal with liquidations and slippage and so forth. But on our system, the traders don't actually pay any liquidation fee or anything like that. There's no sort of threshold between a liquidation on our platform and something like a total liquidation. We don't necessarily strictly speaking need an insurance fund or things like that.\n\nHow do we do risk control? Again, it would be good to understand better, but something to keep in mind is that, again, we don't really have a... We're doing contract for differences, which means the underlying is never actually provided to the trader and it's not sourced by the match or slash lender. So we were able to do up to 100x leverage or even more than that. And the only risk is really... The risk is almost entirely borne on the trader. The trader may get liquidated as they would have in their platform, but they don't have a risk of causing others to be liquidated with any kind of cascading liquidation. And the lender is always going to get their capital back on our platform because if a trader gets liquidated, although again, because if they've hedged on another platform, they need to deal with external risk from that platform.\n\nAs far as the most important differentiators, I would say one of the biggest ones is that we have leveraged lending or what we call concentrated lending. This basically means that we can lend a lot more capital with or provide capital for a lot more trades without with relatively little underlying capital. So for example, if we want to lend out $1 million, we can actually do that with something like ten to maybe thirty thousand dollars worth of capital from matchers. And those matchers may want to hedge again on other platforms but even still if they do, they don't need that much liquidity. They can hedge as they may elsewhere. No other platform that we've seen actually does something like this and if you look at the amount of capital that's lent on most platforms, it's, you know, they have a standard volume that is between maybe 100,000 and two or $3 million. We can easily climb the ranks. And so, you know, if we get as much capital as like, you know, 550K or something like that from lenders, from matchers on our platform, then we are expected to quickly make a splash by being able to actually have open interest and daily trading volume in the several millions. And so we expect that what's gonna happen is we will quickly rise in usage and people will just be talking about our volumes pretty seriously.\n\nSo again, as a trader, you can expect to get additional liquidity here. The con obviously for this concentrated liquidity is that, concentrated lending is that you can only borrow, you can only get a certain amount of profit. So it's usually either 100% or 180% or 200%. You couldn't get, for example, 1,000% in the case of a runaway trade, but we think that this is a worthwhile trade-off. And we can certainly actually allow for higher percentages in terms of wins or profit for traders in the future.\n\nAnother big, important difference is that while we have concentrated lending, we don't require our users to, we still have the same amount of interest that would go to a lender otherwise. So for example, if a user is lending, say $10,000 at a 10x leverage, they're still giving yield as though they actually provided the entire $100,000 worth of capital. This is how we're able to charge dozens or even 100% plus APR, whereas other lending platforms can't offer as much because they're not concentrating the lend capital from the matchers.\n\nSo I'd say those are the two biggest ones. There are a couple other differentiators, for example, we're able to allow for trading against any asset, even non-crypto assets, so we can do stocks and other sorts of things because we're just using price oracles, we're not using the actual underlying. I don't think this is as big of a difference, but it is certainly relatively large. I think our referral program can actually be a really great differentiator. I would say the first two things that I mentioned are the biggest differentiators, but those are a couple of other ones. And I think that's kind of related to the competitive advantage that we have. I think that we have the capacity to build a lot of trading volume really quickly, even with relatively low capital that's lent because the amount of capital that's borrowed is concentrated and so we can do 20-30x. And so I think we're going to be able to basically quickly be the go-to place for liquidity. I just haven't seen the other with concentrated liquidity. Another one might be the use of deployment on any platform. So we can certainly deploy on BNB chain but we're actually able to really easily deploy on other chains as well given our modular architecture.\n\nThe main utility of the token is the interest that you get. So as a token holder, you get governance rights and you also get interest from all of the trading that occurs on the platform. There is actually in addition some additional utility that we want to provide, governance for layer one chain and a few other things but we haven't discussed it as much because we're primarily focused on governance and interest revenue. Even still, I think we would be one of the best tokens for gaming interest, one of the best revenue-generating tokens. There is other stuff related to AI and a few other cool things that we would want to discuss but now may not be the best time. I suppose it really just depends on investor appetite. We're happy to discuss our AI work which is almost an entirely separate product line but frankly we know that investors tend to focus on either just crypto or just AI so we don't talk about it that much.\n\nAs far as project status, we've actually soft-launched the protocol. We've had a set number of traders actively using it. We can link to the tool right now. Anyone can trade on it at the present moment. Although we haven't done much marketing on it, we're just taking in user feedback and iteratively improving it. So yeah, we want to build up additional capital reserves, get additional lenders on the platform, which we've done almost no reach outs for, but we certainly will in the future. And once we feel like we've built up a pretty good base of matchers, we will then do additional outreach. We also want to get tokens from Axler on for SIF chain. And then I think one of the biggest things that we can do is deploy to BNB chain. SIF chain is just in a position to be able to provide a bridge to other chains. And so we've kind of pivoted a lot of our roadmap. But if we do deploy to BNB chain, then we can use Binance's bridge to Ethereum to make auto hedging much easier, much more streamlined, and we can build to a wider audience so people can import and export tokens from Ethereum really easily. And once we've done that, we really want to go out loud. We think we can get millions or even tens of millions of liquidity in terms of open trading. I think it would really make a big splash. And then maybe in the next few months, we'd like to also have our own layer one chain. We certainly have SIFT chain, which is already quite nice, but having another layer one chain might be useful. We also want to deploy to other chains, probably Arbitrum, Ethereum, other EVMs, other Cosmos chains even, those things could all actually be quite appealing. So those are other things that we have. And then again, as I mentioned, we have AI trading assistance that we can help on terms of chatbots that may help people talk through trades. We aren't super ready to discuss that as much now, but it is something that we expect to do over the next three to six months."

    "And so we expect that what's gonna happen\n",
    "\n",
    "is we will quickly rise in usage\n",
    "\n",
    "and people will just be talking about our volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "pretty seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, as a trader, you can expect\n",
    "\n",
    "to get additional liquidity here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The con obviously for this concentrated liquidity\n",
    "\n",
    "is that, concentrated lending is that you can only borrow,\n",
    "\n",
    "you can only get a certain amount of profit\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's usually either 100% or 180% or 200%.\n",
    "\n",
    "You couldn't get, for example, 1,000%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a runaway trade, but we\n",
    "\n",
    "think that this is a worthwhile trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can certainly actually allow for higher percentages\n",
    "\n",
    "in terms of wins or profit for traders in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big, important difference\n",
    "\n",
    "is that while we have concentrated lending,\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't require our users to,\n",
    "\n",
    "we still have the same amount of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "that would go to a lender otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if a user is lending,\n",
    "\n",
    "say $10,000 at a 10x leverage,\n",
    "\n",
    "they're still giving yield as though\n",
    "\n",
    "they actually provided the entire $100,000 worth of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we're able to charge dozens\n",
    "\n",
    "or even 100% plus APR,\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas other lending platforms can't offer as much\n",
    "\n",
    "because they're not concentrating the lend capital\n",
    "\n",
    "from the forematchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'd say those are the two biggest ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple other differentiators, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "we're able to allow for trading against any asset,\n",
    "\n",
    "even non-crypto-cooking,\n",
    "\n",
    "so we can do stocks and other sorts of things,\n",
    "\n",
    "because we're just using price oracles,\n",
    "\n",
    "we're not using the actual underline.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think this is as big of a difference,\n",
    "\n",
    "but it is certainly relatively large.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think our referral program\n",
    "\n",
    "can actually be a really great differentiator.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say the first two things that I mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "are the biggest differentiators,\n",
    "\n",
    "but those are a couple of other ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I think that's kind of related\n",
    "\n",
    "to the competitive advantage that we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that we have the capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "to build a lot of trading volume really quickly,\n",
    "\n",
    "even with relatively low trading,\n",
    "\n",
    "the low capital that's bent because the amount of capital that's borrowed is concentrated and so\n",
    "\n",
    "we can do 20-30x. And so I think we're going to be able to basically quickly be the go-to place for\n",
    "\n",
    "for liquidity. I just haven't seen the other with concentrated liquidity. Another one might be the\n",
    "\n",
    "use of deployment on any platform. So we can certainly deploy on BNB chain but we're actually\n",
    "\n",
    "able to really easily deploy on other chains as well given our modular architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main utility of the token is the interest that you get. So as a token holder you get\n",
    "\n",
    "governance rights and you also get interest from all of the trading that occurs on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually in addition some additional utility that we want to provide, governance for\n",
    "\n",
    "layer one chain and a few other things but we haven't discussed it as much\n",
    "\n",
    "because we're primarily focused on governance and interest revenue even\n",
    "\n",
    "still I think we would be one of the best tokens for for gaming interest one\n",
    "\n",
    "of the best revenue generating tokens. There is other stuff related to AI and a\n",
    "\n",
    "few other cool things that we would want to discuss but but now may not be the\n",
    "\n",
    "best time. I suppose it really just depends on investor appetite. We're\n",
    "\n",
    "happy to discuss our AI work which is almost entirely separate product line\n",
    "\n",
    "but frankly we know that investors tend to focus on either\n",
    "\n",
    "just crypto or just AI so we don't talk about it that much. And as far as\n",
    "\n",
    "project status we've actually soft launched the protocol. We've had a set\n",
    "\n",
    "number of traders actively using it. We can link to the tool right now. Anyone\n",
    "\n",
    "can trade on it at the present moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we haven't done much marketing on it,\n",
    "\n",
    "we're just taking in user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "and iteratively improving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yeah, we want to build up additional capital reserves,\n",
    "\n",
    "get additional lenders on the platform,\n",
    "\n",
    "which we've done almost no reach outs for,\n",
    "\n",
    "but we certainly will in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we feel like we've built up\n",
    "\n",
    "a pretty good base of matchers,\n",
    "\n",
    "we will then do additional outreach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to get tokens from Axler on for SIF chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then I think one of the biggest things\n",
    "\n",
    "that we can do is deploy to BNB chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIF chain is just in a position to be able to provide\n",
    "\n",
    "a bridge to other chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we've kind of pivoted a lot of our roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we do deploy to BNB chain,\n",
    "\n",
    "then we can use Binance's bridge to Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "to make auto hedging much easier, much more streamlined,\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can build to a wider audience\n",
    "\n",
    "so people can import and export tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "from Ethereum really easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we've done that, we really want to go out loud.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think we can get millions or even tens of millions\n",
    "\n",
    "of liquidity in terms of open trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it would really make a big splash.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then maybe in the next few months,\n",
    "\n",
    "we'd like to also have our own layer one chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We certainly have SIFT chain, which is already quite nice,\n",
    "\n",
    "but having another layer one chain might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to deploy to other chains,\n",
    "\n",
    "probably Arbitrium, Ethereum, other EVMs,\n",
    "\n",
    "other cosmos chains even, those things could all actually be quite appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So those are other things that we have.\n",
